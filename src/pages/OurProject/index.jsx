			<h2>Safe Beauty</h2>

				Caring about ourselves is important, and even more so is being sure
				about the safety of the cosmetic products we use.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cosmetic products became so complicated that, even though companies
				provide full lists of ingredients, they are very difficult to
				understand.
			</p>
			<p>
				We've been trying to make sense of it. We asked ourselves: What are all
				of those components? Are they safe for us? Can we use these products
				regularly? But there were no easy answers. And this is how the idea of
				this project came up.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of this project is to allow everyone to quickly and easily
				evaluate the safety of any cosmetic product. Just scan the ingredients
				list and this app will do the hardest part of the job for you. So the
				only thing that's left for you is to make your informed decision and
				stay healthy!
