        Caring about ourselves is important, and even more so is being sure
        about the safety of the cosmetic products we use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cosmetic products became so complicated that, even though companies
        provide full lists of ingredients, they are very difficult to
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been trying to make sense of it. We asked ourselves: What are all
        of those components? Are they safe for us? Can we use these products
        regularly? But there were no easy answers. And this is how the idea of
        this project came up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to allow everyone to quickly and easily
        evaluate the safety of any cosmetic product.

        Just scan the ingredients list and this app will do the hardest part of
        the job for you. And then the only thing that's left for you to do is:
        making your informed decisions and staying healthy! [So, well, actually
        - two things] :)
